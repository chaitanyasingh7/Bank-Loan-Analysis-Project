# Bank Loan Analysis using SQL and Power BI

This project focuses on performing in-depth analysis of bank loan data using SQL and visualizing the results using Power BI. The insights generated from this analysis help in understanding loan approval rates, customer demographics, and financial risks. The project aims to support data-driven decision-making for bank operations through a detailed Power BI dashboard.

## Project Overview

### Objective:
- Conduct an analysis of bank loan data to derive meaningful insights that can help in improving loan approval processes and identifying financial risk patterns.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization of loan statuses, borrower profiles, and approval trends.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing loan data stored in databases.
- **Power BI**: For building an interactive dashboard to visualize insights.

## Features

1. **Loan Approval Rate Analysis**:
   - Extracted loan approval rates for different customer demographics.
   - Performed SQL queries to identify factors that influence loan approval/rejection.
   
2. **Customer Demographics Analysis**:
   - Grouped and segmented data based on customer attributes (e.g., age, income level, employment status).
   - Identified trends among borrower profiles, such as the most common borrower types for approved loans.
   
3. **Financial Risk Evaluation**:
   - Analyzed loan data to find customers with a higher risk profile based on loan amount, tenure, and past repayment history.
   - Used SQL queries to calculate key risk metrics (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).
   
4. **Dashboard Overview**:
   - Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard with key metrics like:
     - Total loan applications
     - Approval and rejection rates
     - Distribution of loans by customer demographics
     - Risk profile visualization for loan applicants
